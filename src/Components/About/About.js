        <p>
          I am a software developer driven by curiosity for how the intricate
          world of software tech and their potential applications. My experience
          as a software developer has primarily revolved around Javascript,
          REACT, NextJS, AWS, node.js, SQL and postgres. I view software
          development not as a job, but as a continual journey of learning, fun
          and growth. The intricate web of complexities present in the field
          keeps have have a constant yearning for software tech. Fun fact about
          me would include having the time during the summer of 2016
          cross-country to have an expedition, which spanned over 16,000 miles
          throughout the United States and Canada. PS: ChatGPT did not write
          this. ðŸ˜ƒ
