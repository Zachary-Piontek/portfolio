        <p>
          I am a software developer driven by an insatiable curiosity for the
          intricate world of AWS services and their potential applications. I
          invite you to approach me with any questions regarding AWS or
          Javascript, as I would be humbled to have the opportunity to share my
          expertise. An adventurous spirit courses through my veins, as
          demonstrated by my summer of 2016 cross-country expedition, which
          spanned over 16,000 miles throughout the United States and Canada. I
          strive to maintain this thirst for discovery and development in all
          aspects of my life, particularly in the realm of software engineering.
          My experience as a software developer has primarily revolved around
          Javascript, REACT, AWS, node.js, and postgres. I view software
          development not as a job, but as a continual journey of learning and
          growth. The intricate web of complexities present in the field keeps
          me endlessly captivated and driven to explore new possibilities.
